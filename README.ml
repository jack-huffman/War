War Instructions
Card game by Jackson Huffman

The card game is played by taking a deck of 52 cards, and shuffling them.
The deck is then dealt to two players until each player has 26 cards.
the players take their deck, with all the cards upside down, and at the same time,
flip the top card over. The players compare these two cards, and the player with
the higher card takes them both. The cards, ranked, and from smallest to greatest are:

2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A

The name, war, comes from what happens when the two randomly flipped cards happen
to be the same. When this happens, the players then each flip two more cards over,
and then compare the newest card flipped. The winner of this comparison then takes
the pile of cards in the middle. This process, called war, is repeated for every
tie between the players.

This process of comparing goes on until one player has all the cards.

This game is notorious for taking forever to complete, as there is no skill involved.
The game is entirely based on luck, but to make the game easier to win, I changed
the response to players tying. When players tie, I flip two additional cards, plus
three more, putting a total of 6 cards per player in the pile. This means that tying
greatly changes the dynamic of the game, and makes the game actually winnable.


How to Play

Playing the game is extremely easy. One only needs to click the "Flip" button to
compare cards between players. I recommend moving the main window so that the "Flip"
button aligns with the outcome dialoge box per outcome, as this makes it much easier
to flip cards fast. The textbox in the bottom right displays the player's score, and
the textbox in the top right displays the opponent's score. The game ends when one
player has 52 cards.
